Input to controller

Q1. One parameter or many parameters?

Ans1. One request dto (which has all inputs as fields inside it)

Q2. Instead of DTO can't we use models for input in controllers?

Ans2.

2.1 Necessary Information => No model has all 3 inputs together

2.2 Sufficient Information => Models which have extra information will confuse the client while making a request

2.3 Models have a single responsibility of representing schema of problem


Q3. Instead of DTO can't we use models for output in controllers?

Ans3. No, the reasons are same as Q2.
Also, ResponseDTO help us give better response in case of an exception

Q4. Should we pass requestDTO to service?
Ans4. No, because same service might be used by multiple controllers
and every controller's method has their own pair of request-response dto
So, service should be free to be used by any controller and hence will
not be bound to request dto of a specific controller

Pain Points
1. Getter Setters in Models
2. Dependency Injection
3. No real db
